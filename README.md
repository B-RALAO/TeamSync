Remember that this app was developed with the Team Manager user experience in mind only ( final project = 2 weeks)

- Dashboard - general overview of what's happening, injured/limited players, management charts
- Calendar - we can see team appointments, create new ones, view them, edit and destroy
- Team Overview - we can add players and staff members, view their profile, edit and destroy
- Management - we can view charts that were pre-defined
- Chat - we can create chats, send messages and receive them. (for the sake of our presentation, we created another user to send/receive messages)
